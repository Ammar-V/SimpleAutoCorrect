# SimpleAutoCorrect

This is a simple auto correct program that I have written to practice algorithmic thinking. It was a fun project and I now have a sense of how complex the auto correct features are in Google Docs and Microsoft Word. I will try to integrate the algorithms from this program into a Word Counter program I made. This project has also inspired me to learn more about Machine Learning as grammar checking would require ML algorithms.

**To try out the program** you will have to download all of the files in one loacation and open them in an IDE that supports Java. Then, simply run _GetString.java_. The program loops but can be exited out of by inputting "/".
